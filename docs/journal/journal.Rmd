```

* available reports used for development, downloaded from RAC press website, pdfs stored in `/docs/original-reports`, see appendix for full table

Next steps: find data

# Thursday 14.3.2019

* Look through back reports available, saving all and saving links here, in appendix 1

* Start query file for Ivo. 

* OK, got all reports, despite missing years, it looks like most of the data is included in other reports as they have a window of usually 4 years previous that they include data for. 

* Now figure out data sources for England, and detail them 

* Outline typical England report

## England data requirements and availability?

* 2017/18 uses "MHCLG tables on parking income and expenditure"

This looks like the data [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-authority-revenue-expenditure-and-financing). 

* For each year there is normally budget, provisional outturn and outturn data, the latter needs to be for individual local authorities, which does not seem to exist for 2007/08, but is available for all other years. 
* The files are grouped under the title *Local authority revenue expenditure and financing England: 2010 to 2011 individual local authority data - outturn* for each year
* The relevant Excel file is usually called `Revenue outturn RO2 (highways and transport services) + year.xls`.
* There are three columns we are interested in: expenditures, incomes and capital charges, these are usually on separate sheets. There is one of these for both on street and off street parking. So that's 6 columns in total.
* There are also summaries, but I don't need them, maybe only for manually double-checking.
* Appendix 2 lists all the files, their links, the number or rows (local authorities) in the table and the sheets on which the data can be found.
* TODO Add the starting row and the actual columns where the data in question can be found and I can write a function to extract the data automatically. 
* Download all `.xls` files to `/data/raw`

* "Earlier, councils also submitted budgets for the 2018-19financial year but on a less detailed basis." where are these budgets? Do I need to include them as well? Ah, yes.

* At one point the England data stops including capital charges..2013/14 is last one. This means current reports are less data rich, and if I stick to the brief, it means that the code won't be able to replicate the old reports. 
* At one point the England data starts including penalty charges for individual Local authorities, although the reports don't do anything special with that, just use the aggregates. 

* England totals do not include the national parks and the Nottingham levy. Not sure what to do with that!?

# Friday 15.3.2019

* OK, so England outturn data is tabled in Appendix 2.
* Now England Budget data
  + not in *Local authority revenue expenditure and financing tables*
  + under *Budget estimates of local authority revenue expenditure and financing for the financial year* the table *Revenue account budget (RA)* has the parking surplus down as 792, but the report says 782. There have been a few other differences, not sure if these are typos/errors?
  
* download data into `\data\raw` and fill out appendix two table with relevant info. 
* careful because at one point there are capital charges and then not. So make sure you've got the correct column. Because these are sums, I would even set up a check?
* OK, England budget files are all saved and relevant info extracted manually. 
* Now back to outlining the England report as it stands.
* E17/18 says national park surplus is 1.7 million, sum of cells DF405:411 is 1.774. 
* Comparing Table 1 for E17/18 to excel file 17/18:
  + on street parking is all the same
  + off street parking: there is a discrepancy. Income is the same, but Leibling's expenditure value is higher than the Excel one (making the surplus lower): 362 vs 356?!
  
# Saturday 16.3.2019

* Comparing Table 1 for E17/18 to excel file 16/17
  + on street parking is all the same
  + off street parking: there is a discrepancy. Leibling's income is 693 vs 689 in the table, and Leibling's expenditures are are 349 vs 343 in the table. 
* Comparing Table 1 for E17/18 to excel file 15/16
  + on street parking is all the same
  + off street parking: there is a discrepancy. Leibling's income is 670 vs 674 in the table, and Leibling's expenditures are are 340 vs 337 in the table. 

* Trying to figure out where these discrepancies come from: It must be the Nottingham workplace levy? Which I don't have data for. 
* Second thing, presumably the difference is also due to not including the national parks. Although I have the data for that, I cannot confirm, because I don't know the levy numbers. 

* TODO write (find) a function to convert excel column names to column numbers. 
* Oh, congestion charge data needs to be read as well, that's in a different couple of cells than what i've been looking at until now, so add that to the appendix. 


# Monday 18.3.2019

* Clean up queries for Ivo for England. 
* Look at Scotland data. 2015/16 is the last year with a report but the data on  [this link](https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Local-Government-Finance/PubScottishLGFStats] seems to go to 2016/17
* I'm looking at `Annex A by LA` excel files, which have LA level data. 
* OK, so data checking: compare surpluses in individual sheets of `sco-15-16.xlss` with table 9, parking surpluses in report 15/16. 
  + Edinburgh is same, so is Glasgow, Dundee, Refreshing, Fife, South Lank, East Ayr, Highland, Argyle, Aberdeenshire, Angus, South Ary, Moray,Perth, Stirling, 
  + Aberdeen city is 4.89 vs 0?
  + If I add Aberdeen city form Leibling to the Excel totals get the Leibling totals for Surplus.OK 
* But if I add the Aberdeen city incomes to the Excel ones, it's still not enough. And same for expenditures... So there is another LA that has a discrepancy. 
  + Clackmanshire discrepancy: .014 -> .02, but that's minor, could be poor rounding.   + South Ayershire discrepancy: .0 -> .80
  + And of course Aberdeen city: .0 -> 9.20
  + This fixes the total income discrepancies. 
* OK, now for the expenditure discrepancies:
  + Aberdeen city: 0 -> 4.32 
  + South Ayershire expenditure discrepancy: -.327 -> .470
  + And these now also add up. 
* Start Scotish data query file for Ivo
* Start outline of Scotland report based on *newly discovered* 16/17 report
* Penalty notice charge data is apparenlty out of a scanned pdf in 2015/16.... And 16/18 data in a regular pdf. But perhaps the tabulizer package could help me out? Unfortunately there are some sort of java issues in installing the package...
* solved issue using [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51256462/r-cannot-install-rjava-what-is-r-api-3-4/51267282#51267282), installed rJava, but first had to  also run `sudo R CMD javareconf`. This is presumably only an ubuntu issue, so should work fine on Windows. * Tried tabulizer on the 17/18 pdf and it works!

#### PNC data

*Decriminalized Parking Enforcement - Local Authorities - Income and Expenditure*

* pdf's exist for 2016/17 and 2017/18. Additionally a scanned pdf exists for 2013/14/15/16. All have:
  + a table of which LAs are doing DPE, and which are considering it etc, this is in the report
  + a table of PNC incomes. However this last table also has other incomes and expenditures in it, so you'd think it would match with the gov.sco data in the Excel tables, but it doesn't. Some are quite close, e.g. Glasgow, but others not.   
* Added table of PCN data to the appendix, created table to summaries the sources. 

*Todo: outline Scotland data. 

# Tuesday 19.3.2019

* Found the 16/17 Scotland files, they're not under press, but under publications...
* Add them to app1
* Actually clean up the data source tables and move them to code, these are manual data entry files. 
* Saving the tables into rds? Probably, it is serialized, and as opposed to csv it retains the data types. Let's me cleanly load individual objects and assign then names, and there's no danger of overwriting an object of the same name. But is not human readable. 
* This also involves using here::here() to load the data in the child .rmd documents for the appendices. 

* **mapping England**: OK, so the data is for 353 "local authorities", or are they actually "councils"? Shapefiles seem to have 326 shapes. Wikipedia says there are 27 county and 201 district councils, *which cover the same physical area*. plus 55 UAs, 36 met burroughs and 32 London ones, plus the city, plus scilly. But they overlap..
* SO e.g. you have Oxford council and Oxfodshire council. The first only does off street parking, while the county one does both. Do I add them up? If I want to map them I have to. But in the tables are they separate?
* OK, found lookup table for counties and districts, that will be useful! 
* There are counties in the lookup table that are not county councils though, these eight: Greater Manchester, Inner London, Merseyside, Northamptonshire, Outer London, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, West Yorkshire. 
* Download UK map shapefile: *Local Administrative Units Level 1 (January 2018) Super Generalised Clipped Boundaries in United Kingdom * [this link](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/e892da8a-bf06-4d00-a8fd-a578b30b1dca/local-administrative-units-level-1-january-2018-super-generalised-clipped-boundaries-in-united-kingdom)
* install `sf` package.
* Get basic maps to work, hooray. 
* Probably want ultra generalized, this is too fine. Yeah. 

* OK, now back to outlining Scotland data. 
* OK, so there is crossover in the scottish report, and requires picking up data from the other two reports...
* Check conditional formatting of tables that work in pdf. `condformat` might work. Do they want it?
* Actually cell_spec in kableExtra probably does the trick [see here](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf). 
* OK, now queries for Ivo. 
* I also now have a much better overview of how much manual tweaking the reports will require (not too much), so I have the idea of highlighting all the spots that need a manual double check (e.g. in red) so that nothing like that gets accidentally published. 
* Add the four Nottingham workplace levy files to data. Need to try if extracting the tables works there as well. 


# Wednesday 20.3.2019

* OUTLINE the whole project scheme. 
* Try extracting the WPL data. No, it doesn't work. There are two other tables on the page and this table is too small I guess, or sth, so it will have to be manually input. 
* Actually, I need to have a look at Wales quickly before I do this. For 2017/18
* OK, summary looks cool: income, expenditure and total transport as well, all match
* Participation in the *Wales Penalty Processing Partnership* and councils where "on-street parking controlled by Gwent Police who are planning to transfer it to the
councils" probably requires an external source, this is in a map legend. 
* Population data is available on same platform [on this link](https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Population-and-Migration/Population/Estimates/Local-Authority/populationestimates-by-localauthority-year)
* There is additional penalty charge notice data, but that seems to be two years behind i.e. the 17/18 report has data for 15/16
* source for PCNs [is here](https://www.trafficpenaltytribunal.gov.uk/Publications/)
* Unfortunately `tabulizer` does not extract the tables properly. 
* meanwhile have a look at importing json objects..
* OK, so figured out how to extract the json file, and even the table, but that's only the first 1000 records. In order to get what I want I need to query it. 
* hmm, ok, massive issues with fromJSON giving different results each time. If i don't figure it out, then it will have to me manual downloading of csv files. Not the worst thing in the world, it's still probably better than the England and Scotland data..

# Thursday, 21.3.2019

* created json-reprex.Rmd file, tested by Anneka and Martin as well, all get same non-deterministic results. Posted on rstudio community, tomorrow will crosspost on stackoverflow if there isn't any solution. 
* OK, start Wales outline including replies from Ivo. 
* worry about tables being too large. [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44490209/how-to-change-font-size-of-table-in-rmarkdown-latex-and-pdf) seems useful
* OK, Wales outline complete.
* Now back to plotting out the whole thing. 
* Download Wales data. csvs directly from the [wales stats website](https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Local-Government/Finance/Revenue/Transport/RoadsAndTransportRevenueExpenditure-by-authority).
* cross-post the question to [stackoverlfow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55277363/r-extracting-json-data-from-an-odata-api-gives-inconsistent-results)

**Downloading Wales Data**

* Export to .csv, without headers, without metadata!
* Gross Expenditure X Parking of vehicles -> wal-exp-17-18.csv [link](https://statswales.gov.wales/v/FMKX)
* Total Income X Parking of vehicles -> wal-inc-17-18.csv [link](https://statswales.gov.wales/v/FMKY)
* Net current cost X Total transport planning, highways, rows and transport -> wal-trans-17-18.csv [link](https://statswales.gov.wales/v/FMKW)

**Consolidating all data**

* Start new file `02-import-data-original.R`
* Design table that will accommodate all 3 countries. 
* figure out how to rename all files in a folder
* `for file in *; do mv "$file" "$(basename "$file").orig"; done;` this didn't work
* `rename 's/\.orig$//' *.orig` this fixed it. 
* haha `for file in *; do mv "$file" "$orig.(basename "$file")"; done;` also fucked it up
* christ, anyway, now manually fixed..

**MASTER TABLE**

* Start by listing all variables required
* Start by importing Wales data
* Decide that the year variable will simply be the first year e.g. for 13/14 it is 2013. Anything can be done with that if needed. 
* Wales data done!
* Scotland Excel files. OK, so looks like cell-specification for readxl cannot handle noncontiguous cells. 
* Also cannot handle single cells - they are treated as the column header.. just leads to ugly code.
* Now to loop everything it would be nice to have all the data in the meta summary tables, including the year (not fiscal year) and the file name. So I'll fix that 
* A, ffs, the name of the local authority also changes cell, and in 16/17 doesn't even have its own cell
* OK, it's not pretty, but it's working: Scotland income and expenditure original data is done!
* Next up: Scotland PCN data

# Friday 22.3.2019

OK, back to the Scotland PNC data scraped from the pdf

* Because the 13-16 data is already transcribed in the old Leibling reports, i can try using tabulizer on them instead of dealing with the scanned pdf file. Actually, no they're not there, and it isn't even important. 
* Next the PCN tables with tabulizer
* Nah, actually these all have to be written as functions, so they can be reused..
* So extra file with functions now. Which will be reused in the templates
* OK, so extracting PCN numbers. The reusable function will only pick out the last year. But I also need to pick out the previous years. So I need a function that picks one or more columns based on the year passed as an argument?
* And of course the numbers have commas in them, so they need to be regexed to become numeric. Actually remove all non-numeric characters. 
* OK, PCN tables done, phew. 
* Next, PCN income from pdf
* OK, now all the tables from the pdfs are done
* Merge them by year, for 14 and 15 there is only one, and there are three for the years 16 and 17
* Then merge all the pdf tables together
* The add the excel data.
* Ah, there are some spaces in the authority names.. in the DPE tables. Fixed
* Additionally five LAs have non-standard name spellings. Need to figure out which ones are standard.. 
* Additionally there is an empty row in the ie table. Damn, this is getting kludgy..
* OK, no3 there is a function for changing spellings of scottish LAs, I'll add it to all the functions. Fixed
* Now go back to Scotland excel import and rewrite as functions. I mean move them to the functions.R file 
* OK, all of Scotland works now, there are only some column type issues . fixed
* Oh, and welsh income is negative .

** ENGLAND IMPORT ORIGINAL DATA**

* First add actual file names to the metadata table. 
* Also, start with 2009, not 2008, because there were 388 LAs then
* So the trick now is to write code to import the original data that will also be useful for updating new data for RAC..
* Turns out the columns with the la names and classes also change from one year to another, have to add them to the metadata
* WHY doesn't this work? Because one cell has "..." in it instead of numbers..
* FFS, ok, this now works for expend.on and expend. off. Now extend to incomes as well. Done.

# Saturday 23.3.2019

* prealocating a data.frame does not need to list columns, this are small applications anyway, so it's not necessary to worry about efficiency. 
* Now add the totals for ENgland, transport and PCN totals, so only one row for the whole country, for each year. `auth.type` classed as "X"
* Now again, because these are single cells, they get exported as the column headers..Same as the Scotland data. 
* Totals import OK.
* Forgot to add country var to England. OK.
* Add the penalty ranges to the I.E. outturn code as well. This possibly requires checking if the data is there..because it's only there for the last three years.  OK. **this turns out was not true!? not sure how i missed this!!**
* Remove authorities we don't need. That's all the ones with an O type, except ones with National park in the name?OK
* Congestion charges. 
* OK, added congestion charges from the main outturn import, so the whole column is imported for everyone, it doesn't matter, since we only use Greater London. 
* But now i see that some other authorities are kept, ones with WM and YH, and one that's even n/a, this is all 2014 data...Ah, I had the auth.name and auth.type wrong in the metadata, fixed.
* Double check no of authorities: 9 \* 353 = 3177, that's perfect! In addition also 9\* Greater London and  The national parks, 9 of them each year, except in 2008/09, so that's another 80 records, total of 3266 records. 

* Budget data next
* actually the auth.name columns change as well, so need to add them to the metadata. * Also have to add file.names to the metadata. OK
* Budget data all OK. 
* Manual input of WPL data OK


** Merge England **

* Full_join not working - too many rows result.. is it a name thing?
* Yeah, in 2014 the outturn data e.g. says "Worcestershire CC" instead of "Worcestershire" etc.. SO probably safest thing to do is to remove all capitalised two letter words at the end of `auth.name` with some regex magic. or three letter words. 
* Still 30 doubles... variant spellings. 
* SO new FunEnglandFixNames for manually changing names...

* so 3266 authorities in the outturn data, and another 366 from the budget data, since it has an extra year, and finally 4 wpl years plus 9 england totals = 3642 england rows.
* plus scotland and wales is 4046.
* DONE

# Sunday 24.3.2019

* Change Scotland lookup tables to the same style as the England one. OK
* move both to separate rds files. OK
* rename data sources file to 00-manual-data-input.R. OIK
* move the .rds files for metadata into /data/01-raw. OK
* also rename all of these to start with orig. OK. 
* **ToDo : Wales doesn't have a metadata file, should update that **
* **ToDo: for consistency, all the original data files names should end with the single year, not the double ones as they do now.. that means also changing all the metadata...**
* Clean up code to read all meta .rds files at once? OK
* Looks like this mass import using assign and lapply is changing the character columns into factors. fixed (stringsasfactors option was off in 00-manual-data-input.R)
* move WPL manual entry to 00-manual-data-input.R . OK
* Also add year to the manual WPL entry instead of wpl.year, because it gets added using bind.row anyway. Oh, actually it should get added using full_join, so they are not separate rows. OK
* And now full join the wpl data by auth.name and year. but wpl logical actually doesn't need to be there anymore, you can tell who has wpl simply if they have a wpl.income value. OK
* So now there are 4 fewer rows than before. 
* so 3266 authorities in the outturn data, and another 366 from the budget data, since it has an extra year, plus 9 england totals = 3638 england rows.
* Scotland has 6 years of i.e. data * 32 = 192, pdf data is for 96 of the same rows, so 192 in total. 
* Wales has 308 rows, that's 14 years by 22 LAs. 
* Now that should be 3638 + 192 + 308 = 4138.
* OK!!

** start wales report template **
* how do i get the year into the title?
* get colours to work (include in header)
* now, i import the whole table at the start, from rds?
* where are the surpluses calculated? maybe i should do all the calculations in the reports.Let's try that. 
* creating tables..
  + empty cells?
  + column headers that are numbers (2018-19)
  + hlines
  + alignment
  + multirows 
  + alingment if you have mutlirows...

# Monday 25.3.2019

* Write up technical background - metadata for original data file. 
* Continue the Wales report 
* ** Add % symbols to table**
* metadata for master - turns out it would be great to have greater london authority separated out from the other london ones.. So i need to fix that in the import. OK, it's now GLA. OK
* Ah, collapsing rows in kable extra is not working as expected.. like buggy. OK
* But updating the package worked! OK
* OK, the row table took 1:26 h haha. But it's done now. And I learned a tonne..
* Now column names. OK
* Oh, dpe.status is empty, and the relevant info is in key instead..fix it!OK
* Oh, and also wpl.expend should be expend.wpl, fix it. OK
* So make sure all the income data is in thousands.. i.e. the Scotland PCN data isn't, so fix it. OK
* AND the England total PCN incomes don't need to be in their own column, htey should be in the income.pcn one. OK
* Finished rows and columns in technical documentation for master data. Commit.
* **The data for 2013-16 is in a scanned pdf..**
* **List different definitions?**
* **TODO maybe figure out throws NA warnings in the import..**
* cross-referencing tables.. bookdown seems to be the easiest way.OK
* **ToDO: sources in technical documentation**
* OK, back to Wales, add % symbols
* Conditional text, seems to work fine. A bit wooden though.. 
* Now have to pull out England's surplus as proportion of transport costs.

* OK, I get England surplus/transport to be 21% not Leibling's 12 %. Additionally if I go directly to the 17/18 file I can confirm that my totals are correct, or rather that the Excel files have an error: the off-street column does not add up to the total they have down (cell DF455 is wrong), probably something to do with Copeland? But the difference is 250 only (thousands), so it doesn't affect the 21 % I get. 
* Next the plot.
* Ahh, the ugly fonts.. was it install.packages("extrafont") that did the trick before? 
* I think if you use extrafonts you have to upon installation also run `import_fonts()`, but only once, this needs to be in the instructions!
* This [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36453126/embedding-fonts-in-ggplot2-charts-in-rmarkdown-documents) says you need to specify dev = cairo_pdf to make sure the fonts are embedded. 
* Hmm, can't figure out how to use extrafont in knitr, only directly to pdf. 
* OK, showtext seems to be working. But you have to add family to each text bit..OK
* the labels are still too large. OK
* legend. OK
* OK, also fixed axis ticks so they are all there. OK
* Now remove ToC from bookdown OK
* gridlines?OK
* fontsize is too tiny. OK
* But now table font is too large. OK


**map wales**

* OK, another detour. First I'll have to manually add the info. 
* Let's do some more text first. 
* Now table 2, OK
* Thousands separator. OK
* Actually, might as well do all three tables while i'm at it :)
* There are these odd gaps in the table. turns out there is an `\addlinespace` added randomly because of booktabs being true. but i have striped anyway, so it looks ugly. using `linesep = ""` fixed that, thanks stackoverflow! OK. 
* Forgot the total line. OK
* Make sure the percent change for the total is also calculated. OK
* add hline on last row. OK
* arraystretch to loosen it up a bit. OK
* Expenditure tables is OK, although last column needs to be changed
* Also getting exactly two decimal points in R is tricky! You need to use `format(round(x, 2), nsmall = 2)` apparenlty !
* have to find a better solution than the font_add_google function, since this downloads it every time..OK, font now in data/01-raw and automatically loaded, all good. 
* Expenditure table done. Added change on previous year. 
* Now the surplus table. OK
* Conditionally format cells where the change is in deficit, not surplus.OK
* Add footnote to make that clear. OK
* Now some text..
* Oh, just in case anyone wants to redo old reports I have to limit full data to stop at current.year. OK
* Now I need to convert numbers to words. `xfun::numbers_to_words()` does the trick.
* Now I need to capitalise these words as well 
* Just did a somersault to exclude Torfaen or any other LA with an income under 30,000 from a conditional text tree. 
* More conditional trees... 
* Damn, the auth.names have spaces at the end.. I need to strip them. Update function and rerun data import. OK
* maybe a page break would be nice for each new section? OK
* had to move the surplus calculations to the top because they are used in the intro. OK

# Tuesday 26.3.2019

* Finish the surplus text in the Wales report. OK
* Because Leibling splits up the surpluses into surpluses and deficits, I can add two extra rows at the bottom. Hm, but that's not that simple since it is different ones every year...OK. 
* OMG, that was a heroic efforts, and it worked! To get the sub group sums conditional on each year's surpluses or deficits, and additionally keep the transport data only for the last year in there.. crazy. OK.
* Now the text requires I extract the proportion that the top three councils contribute to the positive surplus.. OK
* Found an error in Leibling, the 56% is from the total surplus, not the 15m positive surplus. 
* Wales report complete. OK
* Commit
* check the 2015/16 report/
* weird error in the expend table 15-16: Wrexham down as 583 instead of 304 in 2013/14
* oh, this format round stuff is so ugly, need to make a function.OK
* surplus as proportion of total transport expenditure is different in 15/16 compared to Leibling. But that's because he's using gross expenditure before parking surplus, although he doesn't say that in the text. error?
* OK, go through queries and see what is missing. 
* Saving the reports, can i pick the name and folder?
* OK, folder is fixed in yaml. 
* What about name? Looks like you can't change that dynamically if you want to use rstudio - knit. 

* I'm getting an  ! LaTeX Error: Unknown float option `H'. error.. didn't have it before. [looks like this answe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48014265/unable-to-use-format-latex-in-knitrkable-within-a-rmarkdown-document-g?rq=1) is the solution, i need to load the latex packages in the yaml
* Send off Wales reports. 
* parametrize the report. but doesn't work - Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'params' not found . Sorted
* Hmm, let's try some updates and read up on param to make sure i;ve got this right, otherwise an repex will be in order. 
* Aah, RTFM worked. The params can be passed from the rmarkwdown::render function, but they also have to first be specified in the YAML. OK

* OK, what next?
* Process, figure out how the whole thing will work! 
* The trickiest bit is getting to add rows to master, but if you fuck up being able to overwrite what you've just added. 
* If what you're adding always has the same year-auth.name combinations? And then just issue a warning when you are overwriting them? repex.

1. If the anti_join with the master has the same number of rows as master, then you are adding X new rows, and not overwriting anything.
2. If the anti_join is smaller, you are overwriting. 
2.1. If the difference is smaller than the update, then you are overwriting X with X+Y rows. 
2.2. If the difference is larger, than the update, then I can't know.
Instead I can just make sure that the update is always the correct nrows. e.g. 22 for Wales, 32 for Scotland? What about england? if there are different number of national parks, that will mess things up? 

* clean up original wales file names, and replace in 01-orig-data-import.R OK.
* Wales update template ready and setup!!! Works great. 
* Commit
* Oh, and delete the annoying empty folder that keeps cropping up. OK

* Todo Now clean up the Wales references as well! OK

* OK, now Scotland
* TODO: should I move all the code out of the Rmds? It would look nicer for sure. Done
* OK, DPE table done! And that was not easy!
* let's try a map. The scotland map has 41 polygons, I need to collapse them into 32.. 
* More lookup table updating.. 
* map works, but for some reason the font won't work - if i leave the par command there it stops working. *todo*?
* Ugh, East dunbartonshire has lost it's year.. that's the import of the DPE table..Fixed
* UGH, turns out i also don't have Scotland total transport data. OK
* i had originally entered both income and expenditure cells for the total transport into the metadata, but that seems unnecessary, so I'll change that now to just the net revenue expenditure one. fixed in 00-orig-data-entry. OK
* OK, added function for importing scotland transport totals, added the code to 01-orig-data-import, and now reran the whole thing. OK
* Now need to update the technical doc, to take into account new lines, six of them? Aah, nice, code just works! OK

* OK< back to Scotland summary. 
* After 2013 Scotland started reporting their incomes as negative. LOL. OK, where do I fix this? In the import function I think. best. Yeah, added an abs there. OK
* Summary table looks great - but (error) it massively disagrees with the Leibling report. No idea how that's possible, although the fact that there is no data for Aberdeen city in the excel files could be the cause!?
* Still haven't added the percentages to the bottom row. need to fix that in the Wales one as well. OK 
* Wales as well. OK
* Instructions: amending tables with a footnote!
* scotland summary table and text are now OK
* plot. OK
* issues: floats of tables and figures, little control..use "H". OK
* text and code seem to work fine from Wales, a bit of adjusting.. Like the inf and Nans, I still need to deal with them a bit more.  OK
* longtable is maybe better here, trying it out now. OK.
* todo: there are still a lot of old format/round combos need replacing, OK
* OK, scotland Expenditures done.
* todo: deal with the nans and infs.OK
* just not sure why clangmanshire is in the text, check that!. OK
* commit

# Wednesday 27.3.2019

* OK, the top/bottom code needs cleaning up. 
* Should i consider moving all the code out of the .Rmd files? OK
* top/bottom. first use deframe() instead of pull in order to get a named vector. nice tip!
* top/bottom: exclude from list if they have under 30,000 income/expenditure.
* *clean up code: stop using column indices!*
* in dplyr nrow(.) can be replaced whit n() .tip
* excluding rows for under 30.000 is now only done for largest decreases, but should also be for largest increases... That needs to then be fixed in the text.
* change that in wales as well.. 
* OK, done for sco.expend. OK
* OK, repeated for sco.income. OK
* Hm, sidenote: chunk names where there are tables (used for referencing) cannot have dots or underscores in them? tip!
* Next: copy to Wales. OK
* Next: fix that one sentence top three incomes. OK
* group a df by rownumber: group_by(row_number() <= 3). tip!
* OK < a bit of wrangling, but i got the top 3 incomes out. OK
* add to Wales. OK. 
* need to create function for 2017-18 etc..OK
* Note: i'm getting latex warning; label multiply defined, but it seems that's because of longtable meaning the table caption is on two pages. So you can ignore it. tip!
* OK, income and expenditure codes and texts OK in both Scotland and Wales. 
* ToDo funfisc, replace all. OK
* fundec, replace all. OK
* !!as.name.. automated using code snippets. tip! OK
* Next: surpluses?
* I've moved the sco surplus code to the top, because in wales it is used in the text there, don't forget. 
* surplus totals for deficits and sufficits are different from Wales, since in Scotland we don't have individual level transport totals. So that needs to be rewritten
* but that isn't actually true, the information is in the IE excel files... Need to rewrite the import.. OK
* fixed in functions.R and 01-import. create new original/master data. OK
* Now first rerun the technical.rmd. OK
* OK, back to surplus. table OK
* First fix the binning function to let you have 0 as well as poz and neg/.OK
* And do that in all 6 cases. OK
* Now get table to work. OK
* width of first column.. OK. 
* now surplus text. 
* top three surplus councils need to be named..OK
* do that in Wales as well. OK
* Now add the top 3 bottom 2 thing that we did everywhere else, but seems to be missing here. OK
* HMM, when i exclude the extremes because they have too little income/expenditure/surplus, then I am only looking at the top/bottom 2/3. But what if after excluding them there are still very low values left? OK
* OK, turn it around. first find the top three and bottom two. Then anti_join, but just below/above, to get the excluded ones out... let's try this. OK
* OK, this now works. But how do i make the conditional tree simple if there is potentially X number of excluded councils? Where do I do `, and`. OK wrote a function. OK
* This all works now, need to replicate in all 6.. 
* Replicated for Wales surpluses. OK
* still need to replicate for incomes and expenditures. in scotland OK.
* still need to replicate for incomes and expenditures. in wales.OK
* Shit, if surplus goes from poz to neg or vv, there should be no change. OK.
* Also, the transport numbers for scotland are definitely wrong. I am using net expenditure, but I should presumably be using gross expenditure? OK, I'll fix that now... BUT still no correspondence with the Leibling report.. 
* TODO: table of expenditure as proportion of income over the years? That removes the need for the final column in the expend.table
* SO if a change or proportion is nan or inf it should become NA, right? Yeah, but now the problem seem to be the italics... If it's NA and italic, it won't make it disappear. Because the whole column is now character.. So I need to fix that as well. This is done in Scotland. OK
* OK, surplus tables with change in sign. Scotland and Wales. OK
* OK, let[s do a expenditure as proportion of income table for Scotland first. OK
* OMG, this conditional colouring is super hard!!! Kinda works now, but still have NAs, NANs and Infs....They need different colour codes? OK
  + NA is empty and whiteOK
  + Inf means no income. So also white? OK
  + then gray out the text for the ones with too small numbers? Nah, a footnote will do.
* Now repeat for Wales. OK
* Now the PCNs. first need to extract the old pdf data from the Leibling report.NO, they're not there. The data would have to be manually input... Maybe later.OK
* LOL, i had a [1-9] gsub line, which stripped out all the zeros from the Scotland PCN data, eeek! OK
* OK, just the last two years for PCN incomes then. OK
* Manually correct the 2016/17 Argyll and Bute no on PCNs from 3018 to 13018? Make sure it's in the tech doc. 
* OK, need to fix the top/bottom code for income and expenditure in Scotland. OK for income.OK for expenditure. 
* todo: write a function for numbers to words. OK
* change in all scotland and wales reports. ok.
* Now DPE east dumbartonshire's lost year. OK, fixed. 
* also cleaned up some of the warnings. all of them actually. OK
* OK, table 3 - comparing the 3 nations summaries. Can it be generalized, so it can be in every report. Most recent year available. 
* oops, there might be an error in the england calc in wales forgot to group? NO, it;s OK. 
* error: the england and london figures in table 3 of scotland report 16/17 don't quite add up, specifically the non London income is about 2mill smaller and the expenditure about 7 million smaller. 
* OK, table 3 is now done, for both Scotland and copied to Wales as well. OK
* Next: table 4 missing in Scotland and Wales. Then send it off again?

# Thursday 28.3. 2019

* OK, now for the last of the tables in Scotland.
* Summaries for all three tables make the fact that on and off are not added up already seem a bit odd. And requires more ugly code. Maybe I should do that in the import function. Then I should also do the surpluses? Probably. It would be nicer anyway for giving out the open data. 
* OK, import adds up england totals and calculates surplus now.OK
* OK, import calculates surplus for Scotland now. OK 
* could remove the superfluous calculations of it later - although it makes no difference. OK
* Now wales: OK, added that, and also changed that in the wales update.R file.OK 
* Reran wales update, make sure the copy.file has overwrite switched on!
* technical: add this: only on+off and surplus have been calculated. Despite it being bad practice probably. 
* Now clean up all the unnecessary calculations of surpluses.. ok.
* OK, now fix that in Wales as well.OK.
* Commit. 
* OK, the summary changes over past 4 years work now, but don't quite match up with Leibling's ones... 
* Also, he has a GB total as well in there...Add that. OK
* actually, add GB total to table 3 as well.., OK
* This is such a stupid table. It should be annual change, not over 4 years, who can interpret that!? I'll do both. OK, done.
* Now need to add formatting ..OK
* All tables for scotland done. Commit
* write up queries. 
* Add this annual table to Wales as well. 
* Now the table is printed off the page!?
* also r chunks can't have overlapping names, haha. tip!
* OK, clean up a bit, Wales and Scotland ready to go. Kinda. 
* send off queries 5, commit. 

* OK, next job: penalty as proportion of DPE income. That's the table I'm missing, because the data needs to be manually input.. 
* Income PCN and income TFS for 2013-2015...OK,
* and double check? OK. 
* Also PCn number for 2013.OK
* Now all these 3 sets of data are input manually in 00-orig-data-entry. OK
* They get automatically picked up by 01-orig-data-import. 
* Now they have to be merged with the existing data in 01-orig-data-import. 
* double check everything. OK
* OK, scotland report: PCN numbers table now goes back to 2013. 
* Next: the PCN income as prop of DPE income table (table 7 in the original report). 
* ffs, turns out there is LA level PCN data for england for before 2015 after all, somehow.
i just missed it... better sort that out now...OK
* *todo*: in the end re-download all the original data files!!
* OK, the PCN columns for England are now input, although I'm a bit worried about the 08/09 one, not that that matters much tbh.. But also it isn't added up in the total income column there? weird. not important. OK
* so, add sheet and column for PCN data for england 09/10 to 14/15, which i had somehow missed before. OK
* rerun 00 and 01. OK. PCN data for England is all there. OK
* check if the sums are OK. perfect match! 
* finally got rid of the last of the warnings in the import - it was because of a separate call that was dropping empty. OK
* OK, back to the PCN table, it's similar to the surplus/income table, so let's reuse that.. 
* Not sure if i'm using TFS income or regular? try both i guess. OK, it's the regular.OK 
* Oh, OK, income.pch is not in 1000s. OK, fixed in 00 data entry. OK
* Now table is ok, but have to add england and london.. and wales?
* *check that using data.full in the annual, not data*
* just a reminder, "X" in auth. type means England totals for transport and PCN. OK
* OK, the sorting of the table should be alphabetical. OK
* and instead of scotland it should say dpe. OK
* table done. OK

# Monday 1.4.2019

* respond to Ivo and Phill's answers. OK
* Incorporate the following:
+ change visible in text  is described as such in text. (difference smaller than 0.05 is under FunDec threshold). OK.
+ add 30.000 explanation sentence> OK
+ Table 2 units.OK
* There are still some format's that haven't been FunDec-ed.OK 
* changed all the 0.02 to 0.05 when saying two things are the same, since 0.05 at FunDec disappears. OK.
+ delete for in tfs.ok
+ unit in table 2. OK
*  "Income has .. sentence". OK, so there are 12 possible income/expenditure/surplus combinations... I should write a function I guess. Later. Nah, simplified it. 
* million/m. OK
* all other typos. OK
* The surplus/deficit top/bottom 3 are wrong because some are deficits.. query.OK
* also in the surplus table Clackmanshire has no change, but it should, -100%, consistent with the others. AH, comparing signs. but zero has a zero sign. so instead of signs being different, i have to have signs being 2 apart. Fixed. 
* oops, looks like the FunMulti text was not done in Wales? OK
* add tfs table.OK
* *add total to tfs table.OK
* Error: Leibling's comparison table for Scotland: last row sums up the totals for all the LAs, including the ones not reported on by TS. So in the last three columns the total of the differences is inflated by including as differences also ones where there was no DPE reporting. Instead I've calculated the totals as just that: the totals of the columns as they are in the table. OK
* clean up millions. in Wales as well. 
* table 7  13-14 data is in thousands..? FixedOK
* add references.
* Mapping reference and copyright notice. OK
* OK, references: 
  + some are already input into the metadata tables. What will happen with new ones?
  + Additionally there is cross-country comparisons that use a bunch of other references as well. OK
  + Should I list them all? Yes
  + OK, so I need to create a master bib file/table. Of all england, wales and scotland sources. OK, manual input in 00-orig-data-entry. OK. Save as master.bib.rds. OK
* OK, so now when you compile a report, you must first create the new updated bib.master.rds, and from there create a bespoke bib.file. 
* Additionally you will need to update the bib.master file when you update all the rest of the data - todo. OK
* Now the update creates a new bib. file for this report only: the relevant country references are saved into a .bib file in the same folder, with the same name as the report. 
* OK, the report.Rmd has to have the correct .bib file in the Yaml. That actually means the name cannot be dynamic. so instead it is just the country name, and it will be overwritten every time, that's OK anyway, because when the .Rmd is created, the correct .bib file will also be created.
* but the no-cite references also have to be created in the .Rmd file, and this luckily can happen in the second part of the YAML, meaning that the names can already be picked up from another object based on the current.date. 
* Man, took a while, but finally got it to work! OK
* OK, Wales references are now all cool, only problem is this (!?) has somehow broken the table cross-referencing!?
* Let's try Scotland and see how that fares. Yeah, as soon as bibliography is added to the yaml, the other references seem to stop working...
* No idea how this is happening!? Also no idea how it suddenly started working again?! Anyway, refs are in Scotland, needs cleaning up
* rename rds bibs, to have bib in the name. OK
* ONS for maps name needs {}.OK

# Tuesday 2.4.2019

* make sure the references work for Wales as well
* cleaning up: turns out i need to be careful distinguishing between the fiscal year and year published.. in the bibs it's not the published year that's called year, because that's what the ref manager picks up it seems. And so the key actually has the fiscal year in the name because that's the one I can pass to it from current.year. OK
* referencing style
  + date accessed. update APA, OK.using [this style editor](http://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor/)
  + But change text of date accessed in refmanager. meh, this seems a bit involved.. i think i would need to switch from bibtex to biblatex, and then update the style again... Not important anyway. it happens in the WriteBib function. 
  + capitalization. solve by using {}. OK.
  + italics instead of quotations, OK APA. 
  * tip: when using WriteBib form a dataframe, column names shouldn't have "." in them. 
* add conditional formatting to change columns. OK
* crossing zero requires a bit more work...But done for income, now expenditure. This one is tricky. Actually it's the bloody South Ayershire that's wrong that's fucking everything up. I should manually fix it to what Leibling has. OK
* font size of table captions changes. why? oh, because they are longtable... hmm, that means i best make them all longtables. OK
* Also striped rows don't work if you have collapsed. There's an unsupported hack, but it doesn't work with Table 2 in Scotland I'm afraid. OK
* add note on comparison table.OK

* maps? OK, done
* OK, mapping means figuring out palettes, make them nice and make them match the ones in the tables. It also means centering on zero. So probably two palettes diverging. OK [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10985224/r-heatmap-with-diverging-colour-palette/10986203#10986203) was useful. 
* but the example there is silly, if the data is skewed the zero will be way off. Maybe it isn't silly, just need to fix the scale/legend?
* kinda works, but i need to figure out the scale legend as well. OK
* and then split it into two palettes. 
* aah, viridis is great, does the interpolation for you, colorbrewer has only 11 max and then you have to use colorramp to interpolate. 
* yeah, palettes work!!OK
* Now need to be able to swap D and C if i want. 
* phew, some messiness, but it seems to work. 
* Not as pretty as before, but at least consistent..
* font for scale legend can't be fixed?
* adding % to scale.. means need to get nice axis `at` . OK
* narrower scale, means the 
* Now add same palettes to the conditional cell colouring. 
* *maybe inset shetland isles at some point..* Probably need ggplot for that though..

# Wednesday 3.4.2019

* change plot line colours and map. OK
* add alpha to the conditional tables at least? Hmm, so the findColours function drops the alpha values. This sucks. 
* OK, but i can use findCols instead. I get that to work, the palettes now have 8-character colours, the last two being the alpha. And it works in the maps. But in the conditional formatting it doesn't come through. No, it won't, seems LaTeX doesn't handle it. Could try mixing with white? But too much effort. Nope, sorted it out. `FunLigthen()` But i don't like it, so revert to normal..
* instructions: install Latex, tinytex maybe?
* fix palette function for non-negative scales
* change plot line colours.OK
* maybe maps look nicer without black lines? OK.
* references to maps in text. OK
* Do wales maps? OK
* add text reference to maps. OK
* change line pplot colours.OK
* add boundary data licence.OK
* add income sentence to wales.ok
* efficiency error somewhere.OK
* instructions: you do have to read the text through. It will say things like 14% and 14% respectively, which you might want to smooth over..
* todo: millions wales.ok
* instructions: sometimes the float cause text to overflow... not sure why, but the alternative you don't want: where floats are actually floating. This won't work well in a document like this with so many tables and figures, you want them to stay in the correct order with the text. So if this happens manually insert `\pagebreak` at any location that is overflowing to force a new page. 
* fix words to numbers function so that it only works if number is > 10. killing it.OK
* add conditional formatting of tables.OK
* move code out of rmd. OK for wales
* OK, testing external code:
+ knitr options moved out work
+ packages installed work
+ objects are in .rmd environment. so all good. 
* todo: when compiling remove log file. OK
* todo save csv files of individual tables! *Wales OK
* these csv's mean splitting tables into csv-able and formatted for kable.. but all good. OK
* prepare scotland update file. OK
* instructions: bibliography {}
* move code out of rmd for scotland and add csv writing. DONE!!

# Thursday 4.4.2019

* number of dps: 
  + add new params to the .Rmd templates, and make sure the script has them as well. add them to the render call to the list of params passed and then add them into the manual input section of the update. 
  + Done for Wales. OK
  + done for Scotland. OK
* fix an extra space in the references titles somewhere. OK
* CPI, add to both reports.  and bibliography
  + add reference: add to original input. update must do what? change date accessed and year (published)? yes. in both Wales and Scotland updates. OK
  + also update the Wales data reference with the current year as year published. 
* OK, how does this RPI table work then?
+ first need to download it, but only if a current version doesn't exist already. This happens in the update file. 
+ OK, so what do I want: for each report I want the annual RPI for the previous 5 years. So i need the RPI for 3/4/current.year-4, and 3/4/currentyear. 
+ Write function, double check [here](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/rpi-267), all checks out. 
+ insert into Wales and Scotland, works!
* add reference in text for RPI. 
* ffs, one of the update scripts was turning the year in the bib. master into a character vector each time, and every time i fixed it on one side it overwrote it on the other.. fixed. 
* instructions: change the style file for citations if you want. 
* annual/not annual change for countries. OK
* That calculation is limited by how far back you can go - 2012/13 is the last year that has numbers for all 3 countries. So let's just never do one earlier?Nah, the code should work. try it out? Yeah, it works! also the RPI is calculated for the correct period. 
* first clean up a bit, move the bib, report file. OK. 
* while working on wales.R comment out the params, so I can source the file directly instead of compiling the pdf. don't forget to switch back OK
* also, after fixing wales.R i removed some objects that are references in the text in the rmd, don't forget those. OK
* Wales done. repeat steps for Scotland.OK
* annual/not annual change for LAs. OK
* OK, adding the average annual change column to the table is easy. The problem is now the divergent palette. Since it only takes the range of the input to determine the palette, but I need it to take into account the other column as well). But I fixed it by adding another argument for the full range of the data. COOL!!
* that had the consequence that my poor style - not explicitly naming arguments in my own functions, which i later rewrite and add more arguments!! tip, don't do that - but it's all good. OK
* don't forget to add another column heading in the kable call after adding a new column. and in expenditures, fix the last column width. 1.5 and font to 9.OK 
* expenditure table Wales. OK
* income table Scotland. OK
* expend table Scotland. ok
* there are still some infinite values in expend scotland..
* income maps Wales.ok
* income maps Scotland.ok
* expend maps Wales.ok
* Expend maps Scotland.ok
* instructions: this is all stupidly backwards compatible..
* dear lord, getting the maps to play along is a mess... for some reason anything i tried there was something wrong, and my bespoke palette function was not making it easy. especially since the pairs of maps now have to share a palette. Still not sure this is working OK, but separating the plots seems to be the safest option. 
* What if I move them all into an appendix? Oh, that won't work, because there has to be some text in between.. oh, if there are two lines it's OK? [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27444804/some-figure-captions-from-rmarkdown-not-showing)
* Still not sure the merged palette is OK, there seems to be a bit of a shift in the scale, but it doesn't affect the actual readability or usefulness of the maps. 
* Also these bloody floats won't stay in place, even in the appendix..Keeps putting it above the section title.. apparently [from this question here here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/285238/avoid-figure-above-section-title)
the latex flafter package stops that from happening. But now I'm getting an empty page instead. Just leave it, let them fall where they may. 
* Commit
* Aberdeen. OK
* add manually original data. OK
* merge in import with the rest of scotland data
* add template to update.OK
* add bibliography.OK
* quick test and clean up. 
* instructions: scotland don't try 2015, because it doesn't have 4 years of preceding data. 
* network graph of pipeline. OK!
* commit

# Friday 5.4.2019

* where did the joining from lines come from!? fixed, it was because the knit options had been moved into the .R script, so they had not been read. OK
* forgot to calculate the surpluses somewhere!? Aberdeen. fixed. 
* update files should have inputs set to current year! Added check. 
* hmm, but think about this, for testing this is problematic, it adds things to the master files that shouldn't be there!? sorted. 
* Add check to stop from running year for which no data exists. OK
* instructions: tables are still being pushed off the page. use newpage to control 
* if you are recompiling a modified RMD, you can't rerun the update file, it will have overwritten it! why can't you run it directly again? because it compiles it to the same folder. maybe i can fix that. No, I can't the solution I have doesn't work because of the params that need to be passed, especially current.year. 
* OK, so instead I have to add an option to the update file. OK
* changed name: update templates to scripts. OK
* Some defensive coding - the surplus/deficit stuff is still not clean.. 
* SO fix Wales update as well:
  + add check for adding new data
  + add check for recompiling. OK
  + fix bibliography so that old wales reports can be recreated as well. 
* if RPI data was redonwloaded you need to update it's date accessed..Oh, looks like i already do that! nice :)
* rpi dates change!! ffs. fixed. just takes any date in april. 
* OK, updates work!
* Commit
* surplus/deficit text. OK for Scotland, now Wales
* surplus/deficit fixed in Wales as well 
* David's transport totals. sent email. 
* instructions
  + folder tree colour coded?OK
  + step by step
  + wales step by step. OK
  + Scotland step by step.OK
  + outline of folder structure
  + outline of pipeline - short. OK
  + outline of pipeline - long
  + prerequisites.OK
  + formatting.OK
  + multiple labels defined. 
* write readme.md
* remove Scotland 2017/18
* cleaned up the Wales tables a bit.

* doesn't work because of `summarise_at` where i used a list to name the function. I never wrote how i got to that in the first place..the `list(~sum)` notation that i have there, i remember it being fiddly, and now it's wrong. and shockingly it worked on Ivo's computer, which might just mean he had an older dplyr package?
* I should use **packrat** for this!
* Also, add the packages you forgot into the instructions!

# Monday  15.7.2019

* Installing some of the packages needed for knitting the user manual. They are not in the instructions though, because i'm the only one supposed to knit the user manual.
* OK, then seems `wales.R` works fine. but if I run the whole script i get `error while loading shared libraries: libHSpandoc-2.7.3-52CDSbRvPJE5dmoqyPvjM8-ghc8.6.5.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`. 
* let's see if i can narrow down the location..Seems to be related to citeproc i.e. the bibliography. but even if i remove it it fails to compile, although i do gave a .tex file and **See https://yihui.name/tinytex/r/#debugging for debugging tips.**
* Once added the option tinytex verbose i see **I can't find the format file `pdflatex.fmt**. 
* OK, i think i'll uninstall ''texlive-bin first'' in pamac. 
* reinstalled `texlive-most` and get pdfs to compile, but still have citeproc issue.
* installed pandoc instead of pandoc-bin, and that finally worked.. 
* Wales script works for 2016 and 2017
* Let's try Scotland. Works
* I have a `.hidden` empty file in the outputs folder, but i don't know why? maybe to keep the folder in the repository even if it is empty?
* OK, so both reports are working. and both have been updated to work with the new dplyr version or whichever package has changed in between. 
* so this means I have to set up packrat for this to be reproducible, otherwise this will keep breaking...
* commit
* had to sort out ssh authentication. still doesn't work. or rather works only sometimes!?

# Tuesday 16.7.2019

OK, let's go through the comments!
And set up packrat

* Pack rat didn't work - because of V8 not working. Why did i need V8? 
* also ssh only works from shell, not from Rstudio. Asked question: https://community.rstudio.com/t/ssh-authentication-not-working-with-git/35456, no answer a week later..
* Instead I'm pushing manually: `git push -u origin master`
* ToDo: look out, there seem to be some log files being created when compiling to latex, not sure why?
* 

# Tuesday 30.7.2019

* OK, so still no good answer for getting ssh-agent to work through Rstudio, continue pushing manually.
* Next in order to get packrat to work have to get V8 to work, but that seems to be very tricky on arch [[https://github.com/jeroen/V8/issues/66]]. But I can avoid this if i avoid diagrammeRsvg. Can I do this? 
* Only if I rewrite `scheme.R` in `docs/technical/instructions` to get the png out of the dot in a different way. 
* use the system command `dot` instead. careful though, this needs the quotation marks to be the double ones, but replaced all and now works perfectly. 
* OK, so this removes the need for `DiagrammeRsvg`, so should allow me to use packrat properly. * ok, let's try initializing packrat again
* ugh, this is weird, it is still listing diagrammeR and Rsvg, i don't know why though? Ach, they were mistakenly loaded in the instructions. fixed
* packrat initialized
* change packrat.opts option: `vcs.ignore.src: TRUE` so that the actual package sources can be ignored by github. 
* this means that if cloned, packrat will cause it to download any packages required from cran instead of having them in the github repo. which is fine. 
* very annoyingly at the end of initializing packrat you get the message "initialization complete! there were 50 or more warnings.." but then it restarts the R session, which means you cannot see the warnings.. So i don't know what it is. ToDo open issue?


* annoyingly packrat seems to knit all the rmd files in the project, which also produces a bunch of log files that i do not need.. 

# Tuesday 6.8.2019. 

* So there is an R option "options(packrat.dependency.discovery.disabled = TRUE) " that stops packrat from searching through all the Rmd dependencies etc. (see e.g. [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/packrat-discuss/ZtxKQfdFLYc))
* I've added it to .Rprofile, and it seems to work
*TODO: try out cloning project to other laptop, test out packrat in practice. 
* OK, now actually have a look at the Scotland and Wales comments
* Scotland first
* FFuckssake. the plots are suddenly not rendering anymore. No idea what happened there..Always source the update script?
* really should have a makefile doing all this...
* Copyright notice for maps can be on map, but reference cannot
* can the reference be in the caption? [apparenlty yes](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#text-references)
* Seems to work OK, add to all maps
* What is the deal with the "label multiply defined warnings?" they are not multiply defined. And only some of them cause an issue? But it's only a warning the pdf is fine!? what gives?

* There were weird symbols in front of the pound sign in one of the tables. They went away, but not sure why? 
* Todo: mention this to Ivo, the weird sign could be an artifact on his computer, hopefully packrat will solve this. 
* Scotland done

# Wednesday 7.8.2019

* Start Wales comments
* in all the maps the legend labels get slightly clipped...
* TODO: table 3, annual changes only works if all countries have data for current year. need to fix this.. 

# Thursday 8.8.2019

* try to get ssh to work?
* still not looking good

# Friday 9.8.2019

* Start on England:
  + england.R to run all the code and 
  + england-report-template.Rmd and
  + england-update-script.R

# Monday 2.9.2019

* Update Wales template with Ivo's comments from 30.8.
* Update Scotland template whit Ivo's comments from 30.8.
* Reply to his last comment:

Yeah, I get that reading the text it isn't immediately obvious which things are easy to automate, which are a bit trickier and which are prohibitively complex. This section is perhaps in the tricky category. (But I could reuse the code several times in each of the reports.) But if you look carefully, all it does is pick a variable (e.g. change in surplus - yes, this means first filtering out all the councils with deficits) and then pick the top three and bottom two. Additionally (to make it even more finicky) you then have to take out any councils with extra small surpluses, because they look crazy. 

So yeah, it's finicky, but manageable. 

The only thing I really had to worry about here was if there are fewer than 5 councils with a surplus or deficit (because then I cannot have top 3 and bottom 2) and to make sure that the sentence structure works regardless of the number of councils that are excluded. 

So e.g. I might have
* no excluded councils -> the sentence simply ends with "."
* one council to exclude -> I add the text "(excluding XX because..)"
* two councils to exclude -> I add the text "(excluding XX, and YY because)"
* more councils to exclude -> same as before, but make sure the "and" is only before the last council. 

The point being that there are four possibilities, this comprehensively covers all the eventualities, and I can map an outcome for each of them. 

The problem with some of the ones you flagged in the last round of comments is that  the "tree" of possible inputs and outputs is just too unwieldy. Just thinking about what all the possible inputs could be and what one might want it to output to makes my head hurt.. Of course, if you write me the mapping, then I would be more than happy to code it up. 

It's the mapping that is the problem, thinking through all the possible inputs, making sure you're not missing any, and then mapping it on specific outcomes. The one you pointed out here is quite really quite simple compared to the ones last time. Hope this makes sense!



# Wednesday 11.9.2019


* Remove packrat and initialize to renv!
* initialization ok, additionally manually added knitr and markdown as per warnings. lock file written, commit. 
* also add bookdown


**England**

Run through all data originally entered and imported for england:
* England outturn data are in files `orig.eng-17-18.xls` and so on
* about 9 or so cells have to be manually entered in the update file to get the right data out
* england budget data are in files `orig.eng.17-18-budget.xls`
* a few cells and rows have to be manually entered ...
* WPL data for Nottingham has to be manually entered, including the reference data

I think this is it.

OK, so I'll now start working through england.R and the report template. The update script will currently only use the beginning and compiling sections. I will complete the new data section last. SO as I go along this works for the current year and can test it like that. 

* OK, bibliography. Looks like the budget and income/expenditure sources for england are OK, but not the WPL?
* OK, looks like this needs to be first updated in the 00-orig-data-entry
* careful! i've now added the wpl refs to the master bib. in the scotland and wales update scripts i select the relevant bibliographies, which includes england data, but i have to remove england budget and england wpl rows, because those are not used. ok, done. 
* in the england reports I presumably also don't need the PCM data for Scotland, right? Oh, the report actually has no comparison with Wales or Scotland at all?! Ask Ivo about this. OK.  
* I'll remove all non england references for now though. 
* there's a check in the update script to make sure there are enough rows in the data. This is tricky since England has a bunch of different types of rows: 1 gla, 353 LAs, 9 national parks and 1 national total, that's 364. So i'll put the check in.i guess. 
* OK, updating script works so far: creating new rmd and compiling, with working bibliography.
* commit
* careful with the budget references, aren't they for the next year? Doubleckecked, all good. 
* total WPL surplus is the difference between wpl income and wpl expenditure. 
* OK, so england totals are without Nottingham and the national parks? Did i remove these before? 
* data import to england.R needs to calculate separate surpluses for on and off street parking. Done
* Double check this matches the total surplus. Done. it does. 
* Also need to calculate the "fees and permits" which is the on street income minus the penalties. so income.on - income.pnc = income.fnp

* ok, the budgets, i can just add them all up. But they are originally negative for some reason. I'll fix that in the england.R script. 

# Monday 16.9.2019

* don't forget to use dp.text and dp.tables in FunDec for rounding consistently!
* there are two relevant budgets, current and next years. 
* OK, summary table for England. 
* The budget numbers I get do not match David's. But double checking them with the excel file shows mine are right. they include all the LAs, but not the national parks. *do i remove Nottingham here as well?*
* looks like the budget data also has budgeted data for total transport that i did not import./.
* OK, so I imported the LA data for budgeted parking surpluses, but not the budgeted transport totals. so i need to do that now. 
* that means finding the correct cells in all the raw excel files, adding them to the original data entry file first. 
* i'll just replace the `budg.tot` variable, which i don't use, because i total up the las instead. i'll change it to `budg.trans`
* no, actually i cannot do that, because the total includes also GLA and national parks, anyway, i'll as ivo
* so then i need to import the data in the 01-orig-import file. done
* now i need to merge it with the other england totals

# Tuesday 17.9.2019

* OK, so budgeted transport expenditure totals are now extracted in the original data import. This required another function as well. 
* Does this add an extra row to the the table, let me check? Yes there is, fix the technical documentation. Nice, i automated the shit out of that report, just reran it and is now up to date :)
* commit. 
* OK, merging all the table elements - by the way, these tables are such messy ad hoc messes it pains me to make them... but ok, just following the instructions. 
* damn it, the transposing and formatting somehow changes some NAs into "  NA" chars, which is ridiculous and super annoying. i need to make a repex for this. 
* OK, almost there with the formatting, how do i do the thousands again? aha, `format.args = list(big.mark = ",")`
* This is due a write up with a min repex: transposing a table in order to get row and column percentages formatted correctly, all the while preserving the order of the variables/cases. Cause it's a fucking minefield. esp. if you want different formatting for the percentages.. 
* The there is the issue of getting formatting to rows that start out with a multirow, because the text is too long, this doesn't seem to work with kableextrs (repex), so you instead just paste in directly the latex code into the cells required. 
* OK, the summary table is now finished...
* commit


# Wednesday 18.9.2019

* OK, start on summary text. 
* Avoid repetition in sentence if two things both increase or decrease, by only saying the second one explicitly if it is different from the previous one. Neat trick that no one will ever notice. 
* The numbers are pulled into the summary text from the summary table buy row and column indices, so *make sure the size of the table stays the same always*
* finished trend chart. added budgeted surplus line as well, even though it wasn't in the original. 
* OK, now the london /rest of england split. What a horrible table to read, this would be beautiful with a nice stacked bar chart. ask. ok.
* OK, summary chapter finished, commit. 
* income and expenditure chapters also finished. commit. 

# Thursday 19.9.2019

* start on surplus data
* hmmm, check you are using the right data in the chart, Las only.. Good thing I checked, I was in fact using the national park data as well, but have removed it now. 
* OK, the auth names for england have & signs in them, they need to be escaped.. Done
* ah, and the surplus changes need to be split between surpluses and deficits.. This was not done in the originals.. 
* bloody NAs and formatting these tables, such a faff every time. 
* OK, london surplus table done.
* Now the england one, top 20. looks like i could deduce Nottingham from there? later. No, no WPL now. 
* the package `english` has the function `ordinal` for writing out ordinal numbers, nice. 
* finished surpluses. 
* start on budget comparison. 
* Hm, i could add budget surplus per council into a table
* Also, i don't have council level total transport expenditure yet. should i add it into the import? That would make the surplus table comparable to the others? *check*
* comparison of budget to realization done. 
commit

# Tuesday 24.9.2019

* Add last paragraph to budget comparison. 
* spellcheck journal
* spellcheck template
* congestion charge. I seem to only have income and expenditure data - so i have surplus data, but the original reports also seem to have budgeted surplus data... 
* calculate surplus in data table. OK
* find budgeted surpluses in budget excel prob. OK, this now needs to be added to the data import...OK, added. 
* Now make sure you have the data nice and clean in england.R
* and change the sign of the budgeted congestion charge. 
* OK, congestion charge table and text done. 
* Now the apendices, the full 353 tables, i guess one alphabetical, one in order, but add the ranking?
* repeat headers not working, nor is stripped table rows?
* OK, repeat headers works, because i had "repeat_headers" instead of "repeat_heaer"... 
* still *not figured out the stripped rows..*
* aaaa, labels mutliply defined happens because of repeated headers on each page!! SO all good, nothing to worry about, but also not sure how to remove the warning. maybe *open an issue with kableextra?*

* figure out how to get rid of/ or control the highlights on the links, the red is a bit much.. OK, this is a viewer dependent issue. solved
* OK, but draft England report is finished - following the Leibling original.  Commit. 

# Wednesday 25.9.2019

* go through England draft and compare with Wales and Scotland listing differnces. 
* make sure Scotland and Wales long term trends in 2. Summary actually use all available data, not just the last 5 years. todo. all good, slcotland only has five years, that's why it looked weird. 
* OK, there are two summary tables in Scotland, one comparing the revenues and the other comparing them wiht RPI. Both of these should be repeated in England.  Let's try that then. 
* OK, there might be an issue with the GB sum, since it should be for the most recent year available data exists for all the countries.. OK, GB is calculated for years where there are four entries. copied into scotland and wales as well. OK
* second table, annual change etc also doesn't work if you don't have the same spread of years for each country... SO this needs to be rewritten a bit.. 
* OK, i think i need to revamp this whole thing. now i went back max four years, or as  many as possible given the data. but the number was the same for all the countries, which obviously doesn't work. 
* instead i stop testing how far back we can go and siply assume no one will ever start earslier than 2016/17, which means going back to 2012/13, which we have data for anyway, so it's fine
* then go back 4 years separately for each country, depending on their current year -  most reacent available data. 
* add some text, because it is boring otherwise
* careful, if the four year period is different, we also need to recalculate the RPI. ok
* where is the rpi reference? OK
* this will then need to be copied to wales and scotland. Scotland OK. Wales OK. 
* at what point should i *consolidate all the R scripts!?*
* how is GB average annual change in expenditure negative, when all the four countries are positive? Ah, it's OK, it's because they are for different periods. all good. 
* commit
* OK, Income. The other two reports list the numbers increased/decreased/stayed the same and the top 3 by income and top 3 year-on-year increases. They also have tables with both previous annual change and 4-year average annual change. Should i do this for top X councils?
* damn, is there some issue with background colour generally? hasn't the highlighting of the tables disappeared for scotland and wales as well? need another pdf viewer... done. solves the red highlights, but not the background colour. 
* careful, the total row in the income table (probably elsewhere as well) doesn't handle NAs..
* meh, i need to escape the & signs from the start, not randomly when i need to in england auth.name. I've done that, but need to clean up old ones. ok
* OK, and there is sht wrong, but not with the income table? confusing, that's the only thign i've changed.. i'll figure it out later. 


# Thursday 26.9.2019

* OK, found the reason for the problems, it was the extra gsubs replacing the & wiht \\&, that were now doubled. i've cleaned them out, so the reports are fine.
* the problem now is what to do with the exported csv tables, which will also now have the escape characters.. maybe i should go back and change this. it is formatting afterall, it should happen when you format a table, not when you import the data...
* but first clean up income table so that it has top 50 councils plust total. OK. 
* move gsub back to formatting table code. four times i think. OK, done
* commit



# Friday 27.09.2019

* no, first there is some text in income yet. OK that's done
* OK, next is the expenditure tables from scotland or wales, let's have a look.
* add csv table code to all england tables. done
* OK, expenditure code in england.r OK
* add text to template. OK
* hmm, the total rows, should probably be also total london and total rest of UK? ok
* also the expenditure as proportion of income, there is no text about it? add to querries. 
* commit. 
* ah, when i finished the surpluses i copied the code from scotland, but only used it for the tables, not for the text. let's add that as well. But they need to be split between london and rest of england presumably?
* error: there was a sentence that said X councils, which didn't work if there was only one. fixed in scotland, still need to fix in wales. actually, there's a lot of places that needs to be fixed.. ok
* text on deficits falling or rising is wrong, in all reports. OK. 
* also there is an "increase" not automated in all reports *fix*
* bottom two deficits only work if you have two councils with deficits!! fixed in england. scotland. wales. OK. 
* should probably double check this doens't happen anywhere else.. where else could it happen? nah, it's fine 
* surplus text for rest of england. OK. 
* add table to appendix of all non london coucnils. OK
* commit

# Monday 30.09.2019

* ok, so which tables are where and which are in teh appendices? This should also be clear in the text. 
* So maybe all london, with added three totals, and top 20 non-london with added three totals? 
* Then the whole table in the appendix. 
* OK, income table prepared. Split into two tables, third one into appendix.
* added some more income text, income kinda done now
* commit


# Tuesday 1.10.2019

* repeat the same thing for expenditure as i did for income yesterday. 
* actually, once i get the palettes to work again,*make sure the palettes are the same* across tables! 
* OK, done for regular expenditure tables and text. 
* Now there is also the expenditure as proportion of income tables for the previous five years.. I guess i have to do that as well to be consistent. Nah, instead i'll take the top three and bottom three in London and England?
* blog/issue todo: order of variables in spread/gather.. 
* OK, expenditure tables done, two sets in text and two in appendix. 
* commit. 


# Wednesday 2.10.2019

* go through the whole england report
* OK, there's a mistake with income increase numbers. Actualy, instead of looking at the percentage value, i should look at which is larger. percentage values exclude councils that have gone from zero to sth, becuase they are undefined. fixed.
* now fix this in wales and scotland as well. OK scotland fixed. and wales. phew..
* check the counting of councils for expenditure as well, quite possibly similar errors as income..
*  *don't forget to uncomment the parameters in each of the .R files*
* Ja, same problem in expenditure, the numbers of increase/decrease were wrong. England now OK.
* fix Scotland OK.
* and wales, OK.
* Hmm, the allignment in the tables, not sure about that, it's right for the percentages, but not for the thousands? repex? OK, figured out. 
* OK, first of all I'm not clear why some % signs in the tables have `\\` escaping and others dont? Ah, OK, if they have colour specs then they don't need the escape, otherwise they do. i think. yes.
* Hm, the alignment is to do with the fact that the numbers just get too long, mainly in the last row with the totals. so they become squeezed. 
* Actually, I'll just turn everything into millions? Except the appendix ones? OK, also question to Ivo.
* the allignment in the tables is tricky with so much stuff. the non-breakable spaces in front of the percent signs only work in the columns that aren't formatted using cell_spec. i don't know how to get them to work otherwise
* *still haven't gottent the colours to work though..* 
* OK, check through surlpus text and fix some minor quibbles
* now just add the ful surplus tablle to the apendix and we're done for today. Actually, it was already there? in order to keep it consistent i threw out the ranked and alphabetical lists, and just included the ranked one like with income and expenditure that includes the change in the last column. This way all three subsections are consistent. The data is also in csv tables anyway if people what to play with it. 


# Thursday 3.10.2019

* OK, so it seems the red highlights for the links was a pdf viewer dependent thing!? i've swithched to xreader now and it all seems fine now, phew. 
* Expenditure as proportion of income is 1000x wrong because of changing from thousands to millions, fix. ok.
* there's an issue with councils that have 0 and 0 at two time points having NA for change, when actually the change should simply be 0 percent. This is both in income and expenditure. and presumably in scotland and wales as well. 
* Write a function to deal with this and place it everywhere. . done
* OK, income england replaced. and expenditure and everywhere else where change is claculated in england.R
* OK, all of Scotland as well. And Wales. 
* OK, sent off querries round 3 and draft england report to Ivo and Phil
* commmit


# Friday 4.10.2019

* SUper annoying to make sure the csv tables have reasonable labels etc. but not be the formatted types used in the reports, because those are all as characters and loose all the decimal points. 
* 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 14. 7., 8., 15. 9., 10., 16., 11., 12. 13. 17. 
* NB: all the top 20 council tables are actually all of the non lodnon concils in the csv tables. but sorted, so you can just look at the top 20 if you like. 
* commit

* Next set up the update script for new data...

# Modnay 7.10.2019

OK, so now setting up the update script... 
* I should probably be writing the instructions at the same time. 
* hm, the instructions aren't compiling as they used to. seems to have been some update to tinytex or knitr or markdown.. e.g. it doens't like fig.pos = "H" anymore. Also \color{black}. 
* added package color to fix that, but now doesn't recognise orange. weird.changed to red?
* ok, inputs for all outturn data done
* next inputs for budget data. OK
* next nottingham WPL. OK
* Now import the data. 
* hmm issue. what happens if the current year and next budget year tables have different names for LAs? LIke the issue occured now with some Combined fire and rescue authorities. which doesn't really matter for now, but what if that happened with a council name? where is the lookup used anyway?
* Ah, it's OK, they get used in the import of the data, so all good. 
* it seems that for scotland and wales i calculated the surplus in the import/update, only for england did i move it to the .R script?
* And the reason i should move them back is because that way they stay in master, and can be saved in the master csv file. Ah, no, it's fine, the i/e/s totals are already calculated before, so master is all good. 
* OK, now all data has been read in the update. 
* commit. ok, first check it works..oops, forgot WPL.. OK done. commit
* OK, now when merging with master, there is the issue of the non LAs and non parks?
* aah, all good, forgot to throw out all the las i don't need
* ok, so master data is updated, only bibliography left now. DONE
* finish updating user guide. DOME
* Commit

# Tuesday 8.10.2019

* first go through all old issues to see what still needs to be done: 
* make sure Scotland and Wales long term trends in 2. Summary actually use all available data, not just the last 5 years. todo. Wales was OK anyway. Scotland is fine as well.  
* in all three countires, income, expenditure and surplus, there are sentences that use councils in plural when it could be only one. 9 fixes... at a minimum. OK, income done in all 3. ok, expenditure done for all three. OK, also wales surplus done, the others already were. Done. 
* there are maps in Wales and Scotland that are not referenced in the text... Done for income. and for expenditure. OK
* there is no error handling if you enter a year for which there is no data, there is simply no output.. Ah, OK, there was a message, but not a warning, so you didn't see it if you only sourced the file. fixed now in all three update scripts.OK. 
* **tip** warning also acts as paste0() :)
* should probably double check this doens't happen anywhere else..*where else could it happen? Nah, it's ok, everywhere else we've got only highest and lowest, and there are always highest 3 and lowest 2, it's only deficits that might not have lowest two, and that's now covered. 
*  not figured out the stripped rows.. or the coloured ones. This is an issue with kableextra, commented on already open issue here: https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra/issues/427
* one solution would be to just remove full_width see what happens..
* no, that doesn' twork, because it just goes off the page. full width is good for wrpaping the headers. 
* alternative is to install old verison of kableextra. tried 1.0.1, didn't work. i'll try 1.0.0 as well. same. weird. but there are a lot of other packages i need to update actually, all in the same field.. doesn't work unfortunately. 
* *tip* figure out how to make sure you're on top of package updates.. 
* actually, once i get the palettes to work again,*make sure the palettes are the same* across tables!
* commit

next: 

* *Technical documentation - add sources info and finish it off (except for England calculations..)*

# Monday 18.11.2019

* how are the LAs matched. via authority name. the reason is probably that i did scotland first and there were no codes in the Excel files there. due to inconsistencies in naming i set up a lookup table for common miss-spellings and alternative spellings for English and Scottish LAs, so when the data is imported they get automatically changed to the same ones we have throughout. you're right though, ONS codes for England would be better, i can change that. i can't for scotland, since they aren't there, and they aren't in the Wales data either, although it doesn't matter much there, since the data is most systematically clean and consistent. 

* going through Ivo's comments. A lot of deletions, all fine.
* if expenditure change in < 50,000, then that reads as 0.0 million, which looks shit. in that case i'll swhitch it to thousands. 
* hm, there are some odd looking percentages in the england expenditure chapter? ah, ok, it was thousands somewhere, needed to take that into account, all good.
* ok, all of Ivo's comments are ok now. 
* commit
* Wales comments from Ivo, removes two tables. 
* commit

# Tuesday 19.1.2019

* finish wales comments form yesterday. ok. send to ivo, commit. 
* ONS codes for matching england data in import. instead of names. 
* this means adding the column in the 00-data-entry file first. 
* OK, added la.code for the "E-code" of the LAs in the england outturn and budget files. 
* OK, now 01-original-data-import
* add auth.code to master table. and add to relevant functions. 
* OK, 01-original-data-import is now ok as well. so all should be fine. ok. 
* ah, careful, GLA has it's own E-code E5100, now should be fine. 
* now running the England report i'm getting an odd error 
```
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘sf’ in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
 unable to load shared object '/home/mz/.local/share/renv/cache/v4/R-3.6/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/sf/0.7-6/cb1ce05d12fc9d41090f9eb539674780/sf/libs/sf.so':
  /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.30' not found (required by /lib/libnspr4.so)
```
* try install.packages("sf"), see if that helps. OK, that and restarting it all helped.
* OK, so ons code matching is done, in actual fact it matches on code and name, so double up, which is maybe overkill, not sure if i should remove that. maybe i should actually. that way i avoid issues if a name change happens that isn't in the lookup tables either. 
* But no, if i don't use all the common variables, then they get duplicated. so it's ok as it is. 
* commit
  
* Now get the england update script ready for new data. 
* hm, did i already do this?
* then test it with the new england data. and then revert to the old repo, so they can try it out themselves. 
  
  
# Wednesday 20.11.2019


* ok, so all looks good, commit now with 2017-2018 england data. 

* change outturn name of file from RS to RO2 or whatever.ok

* wpl there's an extra * instead of ".

* what if it's not the final statememnt, but the draft one? for the budget?

* OK, so problem: folkstone and hythe being called shepway. should i add it to the lookup tables? or should i change the full_merge to not look at auth.name. but then i have two columns with auth.name, which isn't good. so lookup table. 

* should this go into the instructions as well? what to do if this happens?

* add folkstone and hythe = shepway to lookup table in 00

* but where is it being run? ok, i think it's fine, it's in the funcitons

* but what abotu this: the budget file has e.g. e1203 for dorset, but this doens't exist in the outturn file. instead there are four dorset rows there. 

* bournemouth christchirch and poole have merged in 2019. the 2018/2019 data is for all three separately. but the 2018/2019 budgeted is for them merged as is the 2019/2020 one. so should i add up the three 2018 ones? 

* same thing with somerset Wet and Taunton, which were tautnotn deane and west somerset

* same thing with East suffolk and west suffolk which used to be some combination of sufolk, mid sufolk and sufolk coastal. 

* all of this maybe doens't matter if i just remove the controls for the numbers of LAs that get imported. but then you're flying blind, i mean how do you know there haven't been any changes like the shepway one?

* I mean the matching doesn't matter anyway, the budgets are never directly compared except for the country as a whole?

* ok, running the script, there is an issue with summary.london.prep where i try to extract numeric from charater, but in this example it has a thousands separator, so it goest to NA

* ok, there is an issue with the second appendix expenditure table. not sure what thouhg.

* but there is also the issue if ranking the LAs with "inf" as largest, which is not true, so fix that. OK. 

* ugh, also the "new" LAs are still problematic, they show up in the appendix tables and mess up the totals hlines if nothing else. need to make sure the tables only have the relevant rows in them, so ones with "income" or whatever data is necessary. 

* still cannot figure out what is wrong with the second expenditure table. trying to see if it's a specific row now. It's not any specific row, but 353 rows is ok, more is not. 
* removing the cellspec also doesn't make a difference, 355 is ok then, what about if i put cellspec(colours back), yeah, also ok. so 355 is fine. but 1:357 isn't. and 1:356 is ok. wtf. what about 2:357? that's ok. 2: 358? also ok!? hm, this stopped happening? weird, but OK. 

* ffs. maybe i should first make sure i remove the "new" LAs from all of these tables anyway. and then worry about this if it still persisits. OK

* OK, also in england 2017/18 the budget sum is NA now, need to fix that as well. OK, that's fine on a clean start. but what happens if i add the 2018/19 data, that's probbaly the issue, becuase there are now rows with 2018, but an NA budget value... 

* OK, so when i get new outturn data, it should match the previous year's budget LAs. if it doesn't, you end up with NAs, potentially for both the outturn and budget data, since we are doing a full join. 

* So in 2017 there were 353 LAs outturn reports in England and for the 2018-19 budget year the same 353 reported as well. this was ok. 

# Monday 25.11.2019

* So what do i do with new data then. if the new 2018 outturns are not the same as the 2018 budget. OK. the outturns win. but what about the NAs? I think this is OK. 

* or if the 2019 budget data is not for the same 353 LAs we'll get outturn data next year. Which it isn't, there are only 343 LAs in the budget data for 2019, so there are 10 missing. Actually there are 15 additional ones in 2018 and five additional ones in 2019..

* But there's another problem. because i have the 2018 England row with the budget data only, and then in 2018 i add the 2018 row with the transport totals. My current method for adding new data is to first antijoin by c("country", "auth.name", "year"), so that i would overwrite the data if it's already there, and then bind rows with the new ones. OK, this has all now been redone. Now when you add new data for England, it doesn't matter what the budget data was, the new rows will be the ones from the new outturn data. Then the budget data for next year is simply appended on. 

* if the budget data for next year is not reported for all LAs, like for 2019, there should probably be a note made of this? all good.

* OK, there was an errror because the budgeted trasnport variable for all of england got lost,but that's fixed now. 

* there is now a missing reference in the first paragraph. OK

* OK, let's go through Phil's comments first. 

* Phil commenting on report that i'd already updated with ivo's comments. SO e.g. they had differente sentences in the end of the summary. Now Phil's. mention. OK

* OK, now remove two summary rows. OK

* last thing, there is a problem with the congestion charge for 2019.. I forgot to add it completely. Also, the 19/20 budget does not report the budgeted surlus for GLA, alhtough that might not be super important. 



# Wednesday 26.11.2019

* Ivo's updates from 25.11. 


* remove nottingham references in bibliography. OK

* WPL code is still in the script, and the existing data is in the tables in case this ever needs to be revisited. it won't show in the reports anywhere. but i'll remove it from the output csv just in case. ok.

* throw out map references as well in england. ok.

* but we're missing scotland and wales references for the comparison. fixed.

* also fixed for Scotland and wales to make sure they have the references only for the most recent year for the other two countires. ok.

* commit

* add back scotland 2017-2018 data into my repo! This means adding stuff back to 00-original data entry, downloading the three files again. LOL, this first didn't work, why? because the outturn data file has in the mean time been updated, to now match the template from previous years. not how it was a few months ago.. anyway, all good now. 

* ffs, no, it's not, because they removed the name of the authority in the 2017/18 excel sheets, they used to be in the A1 or A2 cell, now they're not. maybe i can read them from the name of the worksheets? and what if they change it again?! OK, read from sheet name now. 

* still not ok, also the dpe status table for 2017 is fucked. argh, 01-import needs to be fixed as well. 

* now test scotland 2017/18. ok, seems fine.

* commit

* *note to self*: make removal of countr/data eminently reversible i.e. revert immediately and have Ivo download the intermediate repo version. 

* Damn, i fixed the NA budget for 2018, but it's wrong again!? where did i loose that? fix it again. OK, so it's transport total that's missing for 2018, seems to be overwritten? This is the england total. OK

* also, the comparison table is missing in the wales report,  should be put back in.OK

* there's sth wrong with the tables in tech documentation... ok now. 

# Thursday 28.11.2019

* OK, fix the total transport for england that got overwritten with the merge of the new data. DONE.

* fix column widths in summary england table to make sure % sign is in same row. OK. 

* commit. 

* OK, now add the comparison table to wales. 

* check how many LAs the the budget data for next year is  reported for. 345 of them 

These 15 are missing in the budget:

   year           auth.name auth.code
1  2018               Poole     E1201
2  2018         Bournemouth     E1202
3  2018              Dorset     E1221
4  2018        Christchurch     E1232
5  2018         East Dorset     E1233
6  2018        North Dorset     E1234
7  2018             Purbeck     E1236
8  2018         West Dorset     E1237
9  2018 Weymouth & Portland     E1238
10 2018       Taunton Deane     E3333
11 2018       West Somerset     E3335
12 2018        Forest Heath     E3532
13 2018      St Edmundsbury     E3535
14 2018     Suffolk Coastal     E3536
15 2018             Waveney     E3537

and these five are new:

1 2019                              Dorset     E1203
2 2019 Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole     E1204
3 2019           Somerset West and Taunton     E3336
4 2019                        East Suffolk     E3538
5 2019                        West Suffolk     E3539

But these seem to have all been merged, so all good. 

* return two wales tables back.

* found a mistake, in the comparison tables, when it looked at most recent year, it actually looked at most recent not newer than report. but that's wrong, it can be newer. fixed in scotland, wales and england, all good. checked to make sure the bibliographies are correct as well!ok. 

* commit.

* send to ivo.

# Friday 29.11.2019

* Ah, having changed the scotland data input to read the names of the LAs from the worksheet names, i need to remove the input for the cell with the LA name, especially since they probably won't exist in the future. OK

* clean up user manual. 

* remove all references to WPL in user manual and update script. ok. 

* commit

* add reference to renv into user manual.OK

* move code to "do not touch" folder. and update user manual to reflect this. ok

* test. OK. 

* spell check user manual. ok. 

* commit.

* see what was wrong with the tables in the techincal documentationn Oh, it' using ---- to do a hline, this doens't work anymore!? Try updating the package first. OK, so this is a pandoc issue, will apparently start working again when 2.8 is out. see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58397380/error-producing-pdf-when-markdown-contains-a-horizontal-rule-or) or [here](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/41?m=52094810#52094810). just remove the hline for now, who cares. 

* only thing left now is the colours/shading in the tables. 

* try a minrepex. hmm, seems like i cannot get striped to work in kableextra if it's latex? weird. to be continued. 

# Monday 2.12.2019

* didn't striped tables work once upon a time? check. Yes, they did. 
* OK, this got broken, see [here](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra/issues/372), looks like it won't get fixed. using manual width of columns would be the only way around it, because the problem is in "full width", but doing htis manually would be too complicated i think... Noone seems to have noticed anyway?

* *tip* careful with kableextra, especially since it depends on the latex package tabu, which has not been under active development since 2011.. it's great otherwise, but when bug happen, they tend to not have fixes. not sure what the alternative is. Just


# Tuesday 24.12.2019

renv error. opened issue https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/309

# Monday 30.12.2019

No response to renv error issue. Instead re-initialised renv. hopefully that works. 
Hmm, no, not really, but running `sudo R CMD javareconf" a few times and restarting the computer seems to have done the trick.

* Now compiling england gives an error though `Environment cslreferences undefined.`, which shouldn't happen, since i didn't change anything.. 

* following this issue [here](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1649) i added `template: null` to the YAML and the error went away. 

* but that's not a solution, it messes up the formatting, especially the font size and page width.. 

* the issue is apparently [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59193797/pandocs-environment-cslreferences-undefined-when-knitting-rmarkdown-to-pdf-in-r)

* so first i'll try updating rmarkdown. 

* ok, this now seems to work.

* back to Ivo's comments from last week. 

* up/down. increased/decreased.. if negative should be absolute. i guess i didn't make sure all of them were. so i'll have to go through the whole thing and double check. Done for England. Wales done. scotland as well., ok

* fixed the expenditure code that switches between thousands and millions if the numbers are too low. check other reports for same code. none

* also there are some points where 1000 millions need to be changed to billions. OK, england done. 

* some small errors in england as well. 

* Now check through wales. done .

* sth odd happening with the references, there is a ref correctly spelled with England capitalised, but it is in small caps in the pdfs. Hope no one notices. 

* Ah, ok, figured it out, the ref manager automatically uses lower case titles unless you put the title in {{}} double brackets.. fixed. 

* commit. 

* now check scotland as well. OK. 

* commit. 

# Wednesday 8.1.2020

A few more comments from Phil. Mainly typos, two explanations emailed back.

Add footnote and change higher to lower.

#### 2. Summary

* Table 1 based on Wales statistics data, all checks out
* Text based on table 1
* Crossover value from England report.
* Figure 1 from table 1
* Map, is a map, but potentially unnecessary.

#### 3. Income (there is no separate section?)

* text based on table 2, 
* Some conditionals. 
* Sentence on proportion of the population.. Do I have to get the data for that?
* Paragraph on income per population removed, since data also removed.
* Table 2, data from Wales statistics data, ignore the population measures, cf Ivo: it is a meaningless measure

#### 3.1 PNCs

This data is massively time lagged, Ivo suggested removing it?

#### 4. Expenditures

* Text based on table 4, some conditionals too much for automation
* Table 4 based on Wales stats data. 

#### 5. Surpluses

* Table based on Tables 3 and4
* Text based on table
* Some text has explanations for the reductions/increases that are too tricky to write conditionally. But could potentially be done. 

#### 6. reporting

* Non automatable, can leave skeleton text/table if required. 

### Scotland (based on 16/17) ###################################################

* Mainly pure text chunk.
* Available data: fiscal year, link to income and expenditure data, link to PNC data, link to SPRECC report with previous data. 
* Paragraph on data availability on Penalty Charge Notices, incl. source, which is a scanned pdf...


#### 1. Introduction

##### Text

* Text based on table 1. Conditional tree could get complicated as the table becomes simpler, but can make it simple I think. 

##### Table 1

* exact same table as in pcn.pdf, can be extracted directly from pdf and cleaned up. 

##### Text

* Pure text

#### 2. Summary 

##### Text

* based on table 2. Conditional tree must be able to describe temporal trend..

##### Table 2

* Based on first summary sheet in Scotland income and expenditure data files. But it is inconsistent, partially because of Aberdeen, but something else is also going on..
* Based also on total transport expenditure from same sheet, but numbers don't match. 
##### Figure 1

* Based on Table 2, OK

##### Table 3

* Based on summary data in table 2, BUT also data for England and Wales, which historically is already available by the time Scotland's report is due. 

##### Table 4

* Again, crossover with other two countries, additionally this one is 12/13 to 16/17, not sure what to do next window wise. 

##### Text

* Based on calculation based on data used in table 4. 

#### 3. Income

##### Text

* Based on data in table 5

##### Table 5

* Based on data in income and expenditure files, except for Aberdeen City.. And possibly some other local authorities?
* Also includes data from Table 1, i.e. the pdf scraped table.

##### Text

* Text based on table 6.



##### Table 6

* Numbers of PNCs are from the table scraped in the pdf. 
* Additionally the calculated average cost of a PNC is from the income table also scraped from the PNC. 
* 3 year window in 16/17


##### Text

* Based on numbers in table 7

##### Table 7

* Proportions calculated from PCN data in pdf, and income data from xls. 
* Except for Aberdeen..
* Including crossover with England data

#### 4. Expenditure

##### Text

* Text based on table 8, potentially tricky conditional tree...

##### Table 8

* Expenditure data from excel files only. 
* Proportion calculated from income also from xls files. 
* Additionally DPE in operation data from first scraped table from pdf. 

#### 5. Surpluses

##### Text

* Text based on nice conditional tree from table 9
* Also national ranking!!

##### Table 9
 * Surplus data calculated from incomes and expenditures in xls
 * changes also. 
 * again DPE data from table 1 in the pdf
 
##### Table 10

* Contribution of surplus towards total transport expenditure. 
* OK, but which one is the total transport expenditure!?

#### 6 Comparison between Local Government Finance figures and Transport Scotland decriminalized parking enforcement figures

* OOh, interesting! But should it really be in this report, haha
* So combine data from xls and pdf and look at discrepancies, which should be mainly off street parking, but maybe are not just that. 

#### Appendix

* Map based on Table 1

### stackoverflow question:

##### alpha channel in 8-digit HEX code stripped in kableExtra cell_spec()?

I'm (conditionally) formatting cells in a LaTeX `kable` table, and attempting to pass 8-digit HEX colours in order to get some transparency. 

It seems however, that `cell_spec()` strips away the last two characters of the colour, leaving it opaque. 

NB: In fact even if I use the built in `viridis` functionality via the helper function `spec_color()` that has an alpha argument, `cell_spec()` doesn't seem to pass it on. 

See repex below: you can see the colours are 6-digit instead of 8. 
```
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
x <- data.frame(a = 1:4)

x %>%  
  mutate(a = cell_spec(a, "latex",  background = c("#AADC3280"))) %>% 
  kable()

x %>%  
  mutate(a = cell_spec(a, "latex",  background = spec_color(1, alpha = 0.5))) %>% 
  kable()
```
